# Welcome 

This site documents hands-on experimentation with 5G, SDRs, and AI-enabled wireless systems. The focus is on practical setup, debugging, and integration work rather than theoretical overviews. These notes capture real issues encountered while working with NVIDIA Jetson platforms, OpenAirInterface (OAI), Sionna Research Kit, and commercial hardware such as USRPs and 5G modems.

The goal of this repository is to serve as a technical reference for reproducing system bring-up, understanding configuration dependencies, and documenting lessons learned while building and validating end-to-end cellular workflows. Where applicable, configuration changes, fixes, and design choices are explained with enough detail to be reused or adapted in similar environments.
